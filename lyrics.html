					<p>
						Hello, it's me<br>
						I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
						To go over everything<br>
						They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br>
						But I ain't done much healing
					</p>
					<p>
						Hello, can you hear me<br>
						I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
						When we were younger and free<br>
						I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
					</p>
					<p>
						There's such a difference between us<br>
						And a million miles
					</p>
					<p>
						Hello from the other side<br>
						I must have called a thousand times<br>
						To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
						But when I call you never seem to be home
					</p>
					<p>
						Hello from the outside<br>
						At least I can say that I've tried<br>
						To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
						But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
					</p>
					<p>
						Hello, how are you?<br>
						It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry<br>
						I hope that you're well<br>
						Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened
					</p>
					<p>
						It's no secret that the both of us<br>
						Are running out of time
					</p>
					<p>
						So hello from the other side<br>
						I must have called a thousand times<br>
						To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
						But when I call you never seem to be home<br>
						Hello from the outside<br>
						At least I can say that I've tried<br>
						To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
						But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
					</p>
					<p>
						Ooooohh, anymore<br>
						Ooooohh, anymore<br>
						Ooooohh, anymore<br>
						Anymore
					</p>
					<p>
						Hello from the other side<br>
						I must have called a thousand times<br>
						To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
						But when I call you never seem to be home<br>Hello from the outside<br>
						At least I can say that I've tried<br>
						To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
						But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
